<li> What years did you quiz?<br>
1955-56, 1956-57, 1957-58

<li> Where and for what church did you quiz?<br>
Winona Lake (IN) Free Methodist Church</li>

<li> What were the highlights of your quizzing years?<br>
Attending Youth Camp at Camp Mack in northern Indiana; meeting other
quizzers; having Florence Murray, a retired missionary, as our coach.</li>

<li> Did you or your team win any championships? If so, what and when?<br>
We were 3rd in 1956, quizzing on Romans.  In 1957 (first year the electric
chairs were used) we won the championship on the book of John.  We were
runners-up (by 15 points) in 1968, quizzing on Genesis.</li>

<li> What was your favorite scripture? Why?<br>
At this distance in time, I can't recall a favorite.</li>

<li> How did quizzing affect you as a teen?<br>
Quizing gave a focus to our summer, and helped develop concentration and
dedication, spurred on by the challenge of competition.</li>

<li> What difference has quizzing made in your life to this day?<br>
It has given me a high regard for scripture and its importance, as well as
an understanding of the value of memorization so that the Word is close at
hand.</li>

<li> Are you presently involved in Bible quizzing in any way or have you
since you were a quizzer? If so, how?<br>
A couple of our kids participated when they were in FMY.</li>

<li> What ministries are you currently doing? How are you presently active
in serving the Lord?<br>
I've taught at Greenville College for 38 years and am active in our local FM
church.</li>
