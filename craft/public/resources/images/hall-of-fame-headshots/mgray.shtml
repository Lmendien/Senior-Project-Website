<h2>MARVIN EARL GRAY</h2>
 Seattle, Washington<br>
<ol>
<li> What years did you quiz?<br> 1983-1989</li>
<li>  Where and for what church did you quiz?<br> McPherson (KS) Free Methodist Church</li>
<li>What were the highlights of your quizzing years? <br>Lots of road-trips; memorizing all of James, John, Hebrews, 1 & 2 Peter, & Matthew, and some of the other books; singing "So go on and quiz out, good bye bye bye good bye" at Spring Arbor Nationals Awards Banquet with Dan Koehn, Ryan Joy, and Greg Fields in 1987; staying up all night with friends after the awards banquet; pleasing coaches Greg and Nancy Gossell; and Bruce's bad buffalo bonus quiz questionables.</li>
<li>  Did you or your team win any championships? If so, what and when? <br>We placed 2nd at Greenville over Hebrews 1 & 2 Peter in 1988.  It was my first quiz that year, as I'd been in the Dominican Republic with VISA all year.</li>
<li> Did you receive any other special quizzing awards? If so, what? <br>As a 7th grader over Romans and James in 1984, I was the 5th highest points per question in at Bible Quiz Finals.  I was the "Coach of the Year" in the Pacific Northwest Conference in 1995.</li>
<li> How did quizzing affect you as a teen? <br>It gave me something to work on and work for.  It filled a lot of time I would have wasted otherwise.  It helped me to know and understand God's word much more deeply.  It helped cement life-long friendships.</li>
<li>  What difference has quizzing made in your life to this day? <br>I still get thrills and chills about QUiC (adult) quizzing; and I love to Quizmaster and make it fun but excellent.  I quote scripture (that I have memorized or reviewed recently) often in ministry and teaching.  I love to read and study the Bible and to inspire my own children to do the same.</li>
<li>Are you presently involved in Bible quizzing in any way or have you since you were a quizzer?<br> If so, how? I am a coach, quizmaster, and quiz parent.  I have coached for 8 years, and been at 11 of the last 20 Nationals.  I have coached at least 5 1st place teams at our regional tournament, and a 5th place team at nationals.  I love to QUiC Quiz.</li>
<li> What ministries are you currently doing? How are you presently active in serving the Lord? <br>I am a community pastor at Seattle's Rainier Avenue Free Methodist Church. I lead a men's recovery group. I help raise up and train leaders in our local church and neighborhood.  I teach at Seattle Pacific University as an adjunct faculty member.  I have been working at Operation Nightwatch, referring homeless clients to shelter. I am loving my wife Julie and 4 children Maria, Daniel, Rachel, and Melody.</li>
